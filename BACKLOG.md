# SPACE FACTORY — Agent Backlog

The autonomous dev agent (`/auto-dev`) pulls the **topmost unchecked task** from "Now",
implements it, verifies it, commits it, and checks it off. Humans and `/backlog-groom`
edit this file; the agent only checks boxes and appends notes.

Rules for tasks in this file:
- One task = one commit-sized change (fits in a single session, testable).
- Each task states **done-when** criteria so the agent knows when to stop.
- Locked design numbers live in `SPACE FACTORY INFO/` — tasks must not change them.

## Needs human decision

- (none open)

## Decisions (human-made, newest first)

- 2026-07-14: Wave 1 setup time RESOLVED — **240 seconds wins**. Doc line 363 (Locked Economy
  Pacing Package) corrected from 25s to 240s to match the pressure plan. Also ruled: player
  gets enough materials to start → startingConstructionParts 0 → 20 (≈200 HP of manual repair)
  so the repair tool works during Wave 1; starting scrap stays 140 per locked economy.

- 2026-07-14: Wave count / win condition RESOLVED — **no win state; the run is an infinite loop
  with lots of progression**. Doc updated (Sector_Layout_&_Teaching.txt "Run Structure And Fail
  Conditions"): waves 1-3 are the teaching arc, endless escalating cycles after, long-term
  motivation from unlocks/upgrades/expansion. Current 5-wave + endlessGrowth scene structure is
  correct; no win screen needed. Progression system itself is not yet designed — groom should
  raise tasks for it (unlock/upgrade design first pass, then implementation).

## Now (agent works top-down)

- [x] Per-wave lane assignment to match locked plan — VERIFIED in Play mode 2026-07-14: Wave 2 split west=6/vent=1 (exact round(7×0.15) w/ min-1), Wave 3 west=5/vent=3 (exact round(8×0.35)), types shuffled across lanes.

## Verified in-editor (Unity MCP restored 2026-07-14, subscription renewed)

- [x] Y-jitter spawn fix (5ffe0eb) — all spawns at y=0.50 (lane plane), zero float. VERIFIED live.
- [x] Dead spawner deletion (0b4e4a1) — clean compile, zero console errors. VERIFIED.
- [x] Wave spawn windows (83cf622) — waves release across windows in Play mode. VERIFIED.
- [x] Per-wave prep windows (6cd2a78) — Wave 1 prep starts at exactly 240.0s. VERIFIED.
- [x] Review-fix batch (7ecf516) — scene config exact (windows 60/75/90/90/90, preps 240/300/240/150/150, shares 0/0.15/0.35/0.35/0.4), starting scrap 140 + parts 20, HUD shows "Wave 3 — 8 left". Empty-wave edge case (0 spawns) advances without deadlock. VERIFIED.
- [x] End-of-run restart flow (9ca5b95) — restart from end screen VERIFIED twice: wave reset to 0/Prep/240s, hub 500/500, panel hidden, timeScale reset to 1, singletons single, enemies cleared.

## Play-mode observations (2026-07-14 session — future tuning input)

- Without defenses, Combat phase deadlocks until hub dies (enemies never die on their own) — fine
  for real runs (turrets exist), worth remembering for automated tests.
- Damageable had no HP floor: hub showed -10 HP on overkill. Fixed same session (clamp to 0).
- Restart resets Time.timeScale unconditionally to 1 — correct behavior, confirmed.

## Next (groomed, not yet started)

- [ ] First pass progression design: what unlocks/upgrades exist across endless cycles (new machines, defenses, upgrades) per 2026-07-14 infinite-loop decision. Write it into SPACE FACTORY INFO/ as a short spec before any implementation task.
      Done-when: progression spec exists in SPACE FACTORY INFO/; groom converts it into implementation tasks.

## Ice box (ideas, ungroomed)

- [ ] (dump ideas here; /backlog-groom promotes them)

## Agent log (newest first — one line per session: date, task, result, commit)

- 2026-07-15: Polish batch (agent-chosen) — FloatingText reward popups (crate pickups + kill bounties); leak fix: enemies reaching hub no longer pay scrap; wave banner telegraphs next gate (WEST / VENT / WEST+VENT from vent-share math, per doc Warning Window); AutoTurret placement ghost shows firing-range ring; player HP bar bottom-left (120 HP + respawn had NO UI); dead code deleted: DummyEnemyAI, GameEntry, GameConfig, EnemyHealth (GUID-verified zero refs). Play-verified all.

- 2026-07-15: Deconstruct (human-directed) — Demolish now refunds full scrap cost (Buildable.Id → def lookup); hotbar gains red Deconstruct slot (X key or click, exclusive with build mode, weapon suppressed); TryRemoveAt requires Buildable marker — fixed fresh bug where map walls (Buildable layer) were middle-click deletable. Play-verified: 30-scrap barrier place+deconstruct = exact refund, wall demolish rejected.

- 2026-07-15: Map expansion (human-directed) — ground 50→80, 19 wall segments (perimeter w/ 2 lane gates, west + vent corridors matching rerouted lane waypoints, interior room dividers), lanes now enter at map edge with corridor turns, NW/W nodes pushed outward, camera max zoom 60, salvage radius 30. Walls on Buildable layer (block placement + player). Play-verified: wave 1 traversed new west corridor to hub, console clean. Wall geometry has ≥0.6u clearance from every lane segment (enemies don't collide — alignment is what matters).

- 2026-07-15: Map content (human-directed) — 4 new ScrapVein nodes (NW/SE/deep-W/N; risk = distance from hub), SalvageCrate pickups (walk-over scrap, 4 at start + 1 per cleared wave, cap 6, spin/bob). Fixed pre-existing bug: placed MiningDrills never bound their ResourceNode (mined from thin air, ignored yield/type) — BindNode on Start/OnPlaced, strict no-node = no mining. Play-verified: crates spawn + collect, starter drill binds.

- 2026-07-15: UX batch (human-directed) — UIHotbar (8 buildable slots + sidearm heat, click/hotkey toggle, affordability tint), UIHubHealthBar, restart now gated by code-built "are you sure?" dialog, MainMenu scene + build settings (menu button fixed — "Boot" no longer referenced), scroll = rotate ghost in build mode / zoom otherwise, orbit moved right-click → middle-drag (clean middle-click still demolishes, shared 8px threshold), camera pitch + smoothing, weapon no longer fires through UI/build clicks. All flows Play-mode verified incl. menu round-trip.

- 2026-07-14: Unity MCP RESTORED (subscription renewed). Full in-editor verification pass: compile clean, all pending [?] items verified in Play mode (jitter y=0.50, prep 240.0s, lane splits 6/1 and 5/3 exact, restart flow clean ×2, HUD counts, empty-wave edge OK). New bug found+fixed: Damageable negative HP on overkill (clamp added).

- 2026-07-14: Review-fix batch (human-directed) — 240s ruled + doc line 363 fixed; starting parts 20; deterministic vent lane queue (consts for lane IDs, per-spawn roll removed); spawn window spans full duration ((n-1) divisor); HUD remaining count during Spawning; waves 4-5 pacing set (90s/150s/0.35-0.4, endless inherits, prep cliff gone); repair-tool 30× overcharge fixed (fractional parts accumulator); _nextDef cache kills double GetWave alloc.

- 2026-07-14: Groomed (verification items sectioned off, win-condition question → Needs human decision). Lane weighting — WaveDef.ventBreachShare + PickLane(); W1 West-only, W2 15% vent, W3 35% vent; scene updated; [?] pending compile check.

- 2026-07-14: Recovery gap — WaveDef.prepSeconds added, prep before waves 1/2/3 = 240/300/240s (doc recovery+setup summed), scene updated; endless inherits; [?] pending compile check.

- 2026-07-14: Restart-verify task blocked (needs Play mode, MCP gated). Wave windows: WaveDef.spawnWindowSeconds added, waves 1-3 = 60/75/90s per locked doc, scene YAML updated; [?] pending compile check. Deviations found → 2 new Next tasks (lane weighting, wave-count/win-condition conflict).

- 2026-07-14: Dead spawner removed — SimpleEnemySpawner.cs + .meta deleted (no code/scene/prefab refs; GUID-searched), WaveController doc comment updated; marked [?] pending in-editor compile check.

- 2026-07-14: Y-jitter spawn fix — jitter remapped Vector2→XZ plane in WaveController.SpawnOne and SimpleEnemySpawner.SpawnEnemy; compile unverified (Unity MCP revoked), marked [?].
